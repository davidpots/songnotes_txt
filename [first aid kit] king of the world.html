</span>    At ten in the morning I was laughing at something
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">F</strong>      <strong class="chord">C</strong>       <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>    At the airport terminal

</span>    Like, nine in the evening I was sitting
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">F</strong>         <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>    Crying to you over the phone

    While passing a border from a state to another
    Filled with people whom I couldn't help to relate to
    And we stopped a while at a roadside restaurant 
    Where the waitress was sitting outside smoking in her car

    She had that look of total fear in her eyes
    And as we drive away from there she looked at me and she smiled
    I keep running around, trying to find the ground 
    But my head is in the stars and my feet are in the sky

<h4 class="section_head">Chorus</h4>
<span class="chords_inline">                  <strong class="chord">F</strong>        <strong class="chord">C</strong>

</span>        I'm the queen of nothing
<span class="chords_inline">                <strong class="chord">G</strong>              <strong class="chord">C</strong>         
</span>        I'm the king... of the world

    And once you asked me what was my biggest fear
    That things would always remain so unclear
    That one day I'd wake up all alone 
    With a big family, an emptiness deep in my bones

    That I would be so blinded, turn a deaf ear
    That my fake laugh would suddenly sound sincere
    No, I wasn't born for anything, wasn't born to say anything
    I'm just here now and soon I'll be gone

        No, I'm nobody's baby
        I'm everybody's girl
        I'm the queen of nothing
        I'm the king of the world

<span class="chords_inline">          (instrumental break)
</span>
    Now, everyday there's a short intermission
    While I sleep they start dimming the lights
    But I've seen everything I ever want to see
    Screaming "fire!" In a theatre of people taking their seats

    Watch it all go down like a stone in a stream
    If you fall for your reflection you would drown in a dream
    Tell me something real, tell me something true
    I just want to feel there's something left that I can do

        But, I'm nobody's baby
        I'm everybody's girl
        I'm the queen of nothing
        I'm the king of the world

<h4 class="section_head">Chords, without a capo</h4>
<p>Here are the guitar chords used to play this song along with the record in open tuning. This is how Conor Oberst plays his part, as seen in some of the live shows.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Chords, with a capo</h4>
<p>If you want to play it like Johanna (in the band) does, apply a capo to the 5th fret and replace the C/F/G with G/C/D (relative to the capo).</p>
