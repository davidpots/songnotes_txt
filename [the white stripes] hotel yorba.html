<span class="chords_inline">          <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>    I was watching 
<span class="chords_inline">             <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>    With one eye on the other side
<span class="chords_inline">          <strong class="chord">D</strong> 
</span>    I had fifteen people telling me to move
<span class="chords_inline">          <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>    I got moving on my mind

    I found shelter
    In some thoughts turning wheels around
    I said 39 times that I love you
    To the beauty that I had found

<h4 class="section_head">Chorus</h4>
<span class="chords_inline">                  <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>        Well, its one two three four take the elevator
<span class="chords_inline">               <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>        At the Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see ya later
<span class="chords_inline">       <strong class="chord">D</strong>                            <strong class="chord">G</strong> &rarr; <strong class="chord">F</strong> &rarr; <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>        All they got inside is vacancy...   (hey!)

<span class="chords_inline">    (verse chords x1)
</span>
    I've been thinking
    Of a little place down by the lake
    They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
    I wonder how long it will take

    'Till we're alone
    Sitting on the front porch of that home
    Stomping our feet on the wooden floors
    Never gotta worry about locking the doors

        Well, its one two three four take the elevator
        At the Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see ya later
        All they got inside is vacancy
    
<span class="chords_inline">    (verse chords x1, let ring)
</span>
<span class="chords_inline">    <span class="note">(let chords ring)</span>
</span>    It might sound silly
    For me to think childish thoughts like this
    But I'm so tired of acting tough
    And I'm gonna do what I please

<span class="chords_inline">    <span class="note">(back to normal strumming)</span>
</span>    Let's get married
    In a big cathedral by a priest
    Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
    You could say "I do" at least

        Well, its one two three four take the elevator
        At the Hotel Yorba I'll be glad to see ya later
<span class="chords_inline">       <strong class="chord">D</strong>                            <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>        All they got inside is vacancy

        And its four five six seven grab your umbrella
        A-grab a hold of me cause I'm you better fella
<span class="chords_inline">       <strong class="chord">D</strong>                            <strong class="chord">G</strong>   <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">G</strong> &rarr; <strong class="chord">D</strong> &rarr; <strong class="chord">G</strong> <span class="note">(let ring)</span>
