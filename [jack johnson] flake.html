</span>    You can make it up next time
    I know she thinks it's not right
    There ain't no use in lying

    Maybe she thinks I know something, maybe
    Maybe she thinks its fine
    Maybe she knows something I don't, I'm so

</span>          You might just let it go 

          And often times we're lazy
          It seems to stand in my way
          'Cause no one, no, nah
          No one likes to be let down

    I know she loves the sunrise
    No longer sees it with her sleeping eyes, and
    I know that when she says she's gonna try
    Well it might not work because of other ties

    I know she usually has some other ties, and I
    Wouldn't wanna break'em, nah... I wouldn't wanna break'em
    Maybe she'll help me to untie this, but

      Until then, well, I'm gonna have to lie too

          It seems to me that maybe
          Pretty much always means no
          So don't tell me
          You might just let it go
