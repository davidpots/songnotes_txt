Oh you shouldn't fall inside the hole with your old girl and no, it's not your fault, you are a wonder, you are a wonder. And the damned daylight is slow when you're worrying how long it'll be 'til you go. Outside the garbage is piled up way too high, I wouldn't blame you if you leave, it's not the way your world's supposed to be. And when the coals are on your seat, and it's taking all of me to breathe, I tell you run but you stay right here. 

Just like the taste behind my teeth, and like the bullet in my knee
You keep me, darlin', you keep me from up and sinking in the sand
And like the buzzing of a lamp, and like the aching in my aching hands
You are the constant in my constant, you are the salty air in my sail.

Oh you shouldn't fall inside the hole with your old girl 
And no, it's not your fault, you are a wonder, you are a wonder.

And the damned daylight is slow 
When you're worrying how long it'll be till you go. 
Outside the garbage is piled up way too high,
I wouldn't blame you if you leave,
It's not the way your world's supposed to be. 

And when the coals are on your seat, 
And it's taking all of me to breathe, 
I tell you run but you stay right here. 

Just like the taste behind my teeth, and like the bullet in my knee,
Yyou keep me, darlin', you keep me from up and sinking in the sand.
And like the buzzing of a lamp, and like the aching in my aching hands, 
You are the constant in my constant, you are the salty air in my sail.
