VERSE
    D     C9            G 
    Big wheels, keep on turning 
    D        C9             G 
    Carry me home to see my kin 
    D      C9               G 
    Singing songs about the Southland 
    D           C9         G

    A Southern Man don't need him around, anyhow 

CHORUS
            D      C9      G 
            Sweet home, Alabama 
            D         C9           G 
            Where the skies are so blue 
            D     C9       G 
            Sweet home, Alabama 
            D         C9             G 
            Lord, I'm coming home to you 

        (interlude)

                                          F    C    D 
    In Birmingham they love the governor (boo, hoo, hoo!)
    Now, we all did what we could do 
    Now, Watergate does not bother me 
    Does your conscience bother you? 
    Tell the truth

            Sweet home, Alabama 
            Where the skies are so blue 
            Sweet home, Alabama 
            Lord, I'm coming home to you 
            Here I come... Alabama...

        (solo + interlude)

    Now, Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers 
    And they've been known to pick a song or two 
    Lord, they get me off so much 
    They pick me up when I'm feeling blue 
    Now, how about you? 

            Sweet home, Alabama 
            Where the skies are so blue 
            Sweet home, Alabama 
            Lord, I'm coming home to you 

    Sweet home, Alabama (Oh, sweet home, baby)
    Where the skies are so blue (And the governor's true) 
    Sweet home, Alabama (...Lordy)
    Lord, I'm coming home to you (Yeah... yeah!)

        (solo to end)

NOTES & TABS
===============================================================================

General Song Notes
A great tune, as made famous by the Oscar-winning film "Con Air" in 1997. And I'm just kidding, of course. There isn't much I can add about this song with authority, but for an interesting read on the "takedown" of Neil Young in this song, here are a few articles that cover this and the general topic, including the relationship/friendship between Young and Ronnie Van Zant. For what they're worth, enjoy:

Basic Chords Used
This song is quite simply D-C-G the entire time, for all of the intro/verse/chorus/interlude/solo. Easy to remember! Actually, there are a few minor variations. The first is the inclusion of a F-C-D progression solely on the "Boo, hoo, hoo!" portion -- which is played once. Otherwise, let me note that C9 and C are basically interchangeable in this song -- C9 (which is really "Cadd9") is simply adding a single note, with your pinky or ring finger, which slightly modifies the C chord.

e-|-----2------0----------- ----1----
B-|-----3------3------3---- ----1----
G-|-----2------0------0---- ----2----
D-|-----0------2------0---- ----3----
A-|------------3------2---- ----3----
E-|-------------------3---- ----1----
        D    Cadd9    G         F 

Playing the Main Riff
Here is the basic, essential core of the main riff heard in the intro and throughout this song. Note, you'll find micro variations of this riff elsewhere online and in the video lessons I reference on this page -- but for starting out, this tab is plenty to get you started. Remember, play it in a way that works for you -- and add to it / improve / refine as your talent and interest afford. And listen along for reference, especially for the rhythm -- these tabs focus on the notes.

e-|--------------------------------3------------------------|-
B-|-------3------------3-----------3------------------------|-
G-|---------2------------0---------0------------------------|-
D-|---0-0--------------------------0--------0h2--0----------|-
A-|----------------3-3-------------2----0h2---------2--0h2--|-

Variations to the Main Riff Hammer-On Portion
When listening to the recorded version of this song, you'll notice several ways in which the tailing hammer-on portion of the main riff is changed. Here are a few. Learn and use these to the extent they're helpful.

Here, you're taking the last two notes up to the G string (I use my ring finger to pull off the 2nd fret here). This is actually what is heard on the intro to the song, as per the album:

e-|-------------------------|-
B-|-------------------------|-
G-|-------------------2p0---|-
D-|---------0h2--0----------|-
A-|-----0h2---------3-------|-
E-|-------------------------|-

In the verses, the hammer-on section is sometimes played like this:

e-|-------------------------|-
B-|-------------------------|-
G-|-----------0---0---------|-
D-|-------------------------|-
A-|-----0h1h2-------0h2-----|-
E-|-------------------------|-

In the choruses, you'll hear them ending this riff by resolving to the C-note (5th string, 3rd fret):

e-|-------------------------|-
B-|-------------------------|-
G-|-------------------------|-
D-|---------0h2--0----------|-
A-|-----0h2------------3----|-
E-|-------------------------|-

Finally, for the very cool-sounding repeating hammer-on effect heard during the chorus, use something like this. This may take a bit of practice to pull off and stay perfectly in rhythm with the song tempo.

e-|---------------------------------------|-
B-|---------------------------------------|-
G-|---------------------------------------|-
D-|---------0-----0-----0-----0-----0-----|-
A-|-----0h2---0h2---0h2---0h2---0h2---0---|-
E-|---------------------------------------|-

Interlude Riff
This is another fun riff to add to your bag of tricks. To hear this in the song, listen out for those "interlude" sections that I note inline with the lyrics. Here's a few ways to play that riff. 

This first method used barred chords a bit up the fretboard. A key to understanding this method is realizing that your hands should be in position for the D at x9777x, and for the C at x7555x. Understanding those are your base positions, the following riffs are a bit easier to contextualize. I prefer playing it like this (versus the method shown next), since you can anchor your hand in each barre chord position while playing the lead notes.

e-|--------------------|---------------|------------------|-------------
B-|----------7--7------|--------5--5---|------------------|-------------
G-|----------7--7------|--------5--5---|---------0-0------|---4--2--0---
D-|----------7--7--7---|--------5--5---|------------------|-------------  x2
A-|---7h8h9--------9---|---5h7---------|---0h1h2----------|-------------
E-|--------------------|---------------|--------------3---|-------------
      D                    C               G 

Alternatively, shown below is a way to play the same fill closer to the neck of the guitar (without barre chords). I find this technique a bit tricker, but if nothing else it is helpful to practice. Refer to the Nail Guitar Licks video lesson (below) to see this played, which is immensely helpful.

e-|-----------------|------------------|------------------|-------------
B-|----------3------|--------1--1------|------------------|-------------
G-|-----------------|------------------|---------0-0------|---4--2--0---
D-|---2h3h4-----4---|---1h2--------2---|------------------|-------------  x2
A-|-----------------|------------------|---0h1h2----------|-------------
E-|-----------------|------------------|--------------3---|-------------
      D                 C                  G

Most Recommended Guitar Lesson
After looking around YouTube, I believe this is the best of all the lessons available for this song (via Nail Guitar). Terrific breakdown of the chords, rhythm, strumming, and the main riff.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVVIplDK7lY

Nail Guitar also made this video, which focuses on the lead guitar lick used in this song (head in the interlude). Note that he plays this differently than Marty and Justin (whose videos are below) -- I recommend watching them all if you can, it will show you how there is often more than one proper way to play something.

Other Recommended Lessons
If you want some other lessons for context, here's Marty Schwartz giving one of his great-as-always guitar lessons for this song, breaking down the chords and each riff very slowly. Highly recommended if you want to see someone playing the song for reference.

And, here's Justin Sandercoe with two lessons on this song. In the 1st video he covers the basic chords and intro section, while in the 2nd video he continues into the verse, chorus, and interlude areas. Like Marty above, he does a great job breaking everything down.
