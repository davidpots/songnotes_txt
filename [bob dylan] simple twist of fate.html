    They walked along by the old canal, a little confused, I remember well
    And stopped into a strange hotel with the neon burning bright
    He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
    Moving with a simple twist of fate

    A saxophone someplace far off played as she was walking along by the arcade
    As a light bust through a beat-up shade where he was waking up
    She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
    And forgot about a simple twist of fate

<span class="chords_inline">    (instrumental verse)
</span>
    He woke up, the room was bare, he didn't see her anywhere
    He told himself he didn't care, pushed the window opened wide
    Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
    Brought on by a simple twist of fate

    He hears the ticking of the clocks and walks along with a parrot that talks
    Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailors all come in
    Maybe she'll pick him out again, how long must he wait
    One more time for a simple twist of fate

    People tell me it's a sin to know and feel too much within
    I still believe she was my twin, but I lost the ring
    She was born in spring, but I was born too late
    Blame it on a simple twist of fate

<h4 class="section_head">Standard Tuning, No Capo</h4>
<p>Disclaimer! This tab is for a standard tuning transcription of this song, sans capo, so I can play &amp; sing along to the Blood on the Tracks album version without retuning my guitar. I realize there are alternative tunings (Open D, etc) that Bob Dylan uses -- but I'm not going to cover those here. If you're interested in these alternative tunings, or the alternative lyrics Dylan sings, <a href="http://dylanchords.info/16_bott/simple_twist_of_fate.htm">check out this page</a>. Good luck!</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here is how you play the chords used in this song (in my standard tuning transcription shown above). You can certainly add whatever flourishes you desire to any of these chords, but these tabs should give a proper starting point.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|----0------0------0------0-----0-----0-----------
B-|----0------0------0------2-----0-----1-----4-----
G-|----1------1------1------2-----2-----2-----4-----
D-|----2------1------0------2-----2-----2-----4-----
A-|----2------2------2------0-----0-----0-----2-----
E-|----0------0------0------------------------------
       <strong class="chord">E</strong>    <strong class="chord">Emaj7</strong>    <strong class="chord">E7</strong>     <strong class="chord">A</strong>   <strong class="chord">Asus2</strong>   <strong class="chord">Am</strong>    <strong class="chord">B</strong> </pre>

<h4 class="section_head">Emphasizing the E-Emaj7-E7 Bass Notes</h4>
<p>One small technique I want to share is how I play the opening chords of the progression (i.e., the E-Emaj7-E7) so that their walking-down bass note is properly emphasized amidst all the strumming. In summary, I'll pick the bass note on the D string a single time before strumming for the rest of the measure -- and I'll repeat this once when I change to each new chord. The tab, roughly, would look like this. You'll obviously need to insert the strumming into the "..." gaps below.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|------0---     ------0---     -----0---     ------0---
B-|------0---     ------0---     -----0---     ------2---
G-|------1---     ------1---     -----1---     ------2---
D-|---2--2--- ... ---1--1--- ... --0--0--- ... ------2--- ...etc
A-|------2---     ------2---     -----2---     ---0--0---
E-|------0---     ------0---     -----0---     ----------
         <strong class="chord">E</strong>            <strong class="chord">Emaj7</strong>           <strong class="chord">E7</strong>             <strong class="chord">A</strong> </pre>

<p>A nice bonus of this approach: you can use this same pattern for the opening chords of Dylan's "You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go," also from the Blood on the Tracks album.</p>
