VERSE
                         D 
    I never knew I was a lover
                                       Bm 
    Just 'cause I steal the things you hide
                                    G            A7 
    Just 'cause I focus while we're dancing off
                                D 
    Just 'cause I offered you a ride

    Still, I am not from Barcelona
    I am not even from Madrid
    I am a native of the North folk
    And that could mess up any kid

CHORUS
                 A7                           Em/B  
        Well, if you....... could reinvent my name
                 A7                           G     Aadd8 
        Well, if you... oh, could redirect my day
                               D 
        I wanna be the King of Spain

    And I will settle in Pamplona
    And I'll provoke the bulls with words
    And then I'll send a man to meet them all
    Blood is fake, so I have heard

    And all the se√±oritas sighing
    Oh, will be the fountain of my lies
    But while we're floating in siestas
    You search for bottles and for knives

        Well, if you....... could reinvent my name
        Well, if you... oh, could redirect my day
        I wanna be the King of Spain

BREAK
            D ... D ... D ... D ...
            G ... A ... D ... D ...

    And I'll wear my boots of Spanish leather
    Oh, while I'm tightening my crown
    I'll disappear in some flamenco
    Perhaps I'll reach the other side

    Why are you stamping my illusion?
    Just cause I stole some eagle's wings
    Because you named me as your lover
    Well, I thought I could be anything

        Well, if you....... could reinvent my name
        Well, if you... oh, could redirect my day
        I wanna be the King of Spain

NOTES & TABS
===============================================================================

CAPO 6th FRET, STANDARD TUNING
The chords and tabs I provide assume you're in standard tuning using a capo on the 6th fret -- which will let you play along with the album if you wish. When the artist plays this song, he is using an open tuning variety which I am not showing here. Look elsewhere online if you want to see exactly how he plays it.

BASIC CHORDS USED
Here are the basic chords this song uses, relative to the capo (which should be on the 6th fret if you want to play in the same key as the recorded version). The Dadd6 and Add8 shown below are optional, but likely helpful in emulating the sound heard on the record. The Dadd6 is used in the main riff, while the A7 and Aadd8 is used in the chorus.

e-|---2---2----0----3-----3----    ----2------3------5------
B-|---3---3----2----0-----0----    ----3------2------2------
G-|---2---4----2----0-----0----    ----4------2------2------
D-|---0---4----2----2-----0----    ----0------2------2------
A-|-------2----0----2-----2----    -----------0------0------
E-|-----------------------3----    -------------------------
      D   Bm   A   Em/B   G          Dadd6    A7   Aadd8 

PLAYING THE SIGNATURE D-RIFF
The main riff played throughout this song can be played as follows. Simply use your pinky on the G string to play the Dadd6 (as shown below), and of course listen along for the strumming pattern and proper emphases. Play close attention to when the high E string is either played or not played -- especially in the more subtle sections (when it is not played). In the choruses and heavier sections, alternatively, these strings are emphasized.

OPENING INTRO RIFF
Finally, here is how I like to play the very beginning of the intro. The strumming here is very approximated (and simplified to save space) -- listen along for the exact timing.

e-|---2----2-2-2----5--2--3--2----2-2-2---|---10---9---|--3-3-3--|--5-5-5----||
B-|---3----3-3-3----3--3--3--3----3-3-3---|---10--10---|--3-3-3--|--5-5-5----||
G-|---2----2-2-2----2--2--2--2----2-2-2---|------------|--4-4-4--|--6-6-6----||
D-|---0----0-0-0----0-------------0-0-0---|------------|---------|-----------||
A-|---------------------------------------|------------|---------|-----------||
E-|---------------------------------------|------------|---------|-----------||
      D                                                   G         A
