THE LION'S ROAR
by First Aid Kit
===============================================================================
INTRO
    Am .. Am .. Am .. Am ..
    C  .. G  .. Am .. Am ..
    Am .. Am ..

VERSE
             Am           C        G         Am
    Now, the pale morning sings of forgotten things
                Am                 C           Am
    She plays a tune for those who wish to overlook
    The fact that they've been blindly deceived
    By those who preach and pray and teach
    But she falls short and the night explodes in laughter

    But don't you come here and say I didn't warn you
    About the way your world can alter
    And oh, how you try to command it all still
    Every single time it all shifts one way or the other

CHORUS
                  F       C                 G           Am
        And I'm a goddamn coward, but then again so are you
        And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
        Has me evading and hollering for you
        And I never really knew what... to do

    (intro chords)

    Well, I guess sometimes I wish you were a little more predictable
    That I could read you just like a book
    For now I can only guess what's coming next
    By examining your timid smile
    And the ways of the old, old winds blowing you back around

        And I'm a goddamn fool, but then again so are you
        And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
        Has me seeking out and searching for you
        And I never really knew what... to do

    (intro chords)

BRIDGE
            D                     F             Am
            Sometimes I wish I could find my Rosemary Hill
            I'd sit there and look at the deserted lakes and I'd sing

        And every once in a while I'd sing a song for you
        That would rise above the mountains and the stars and the sea
        And if I wanted it to
        It would lead you back to me

        (let chords ring)
        And the lion's roar, the lion's roar
        Is something that I have heard before
        A children's tale, the lonesome wail of a lion's roar

    (intro chords, end on Am and let ring)

NOTES & TABS
===============================================================================

No Capo, Standard Tuning
The chords above assume you're not using a capo -- and you'll still be able to play along with the recorded version of the song. I've seen Johanna (the First Aid Kit guitarist) use a capo when playing -- but I don't think it is necessary to do so.

Chords Used
Here are the chords used to play this song as shown above.

e-|----0-----3----3----1----2-----
B-|----1-----1----0----1----3-----
G-|----2-----0----0----2----2-----
D-|----2-----2----0----3----0-----
A-|----0-----3----2----3----------
E-|---------------3----1----------
       Am    C    G    F    D

Intro Tab
To simulate the guitar riff in the intro, I use something similar to this. Basically just remove your fingers from the Am chord at the proper point in the strumming pattern. Keep up this strumming pattern when switching to the C, G, and back to the Am. Listen along for reference.

e-|------------------------|------------------------|-
B-|----------------1--1----|----------------1--1----|-
G-|----2-----2-----0--2----|----2-----2-----0--2----|-
D-|----2-----2-----0--2----|----2-----2-----0--2----|-   ...etc
A-|----0-----0-----0--0----|----0-----0-----0--0----|-
