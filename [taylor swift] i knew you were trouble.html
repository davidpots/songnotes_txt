</span>    Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>    I was in your sights, you got me alone
<span class="chords_inline">        <strong class="chord">Am</strong> 
</span>    You found me, you found me
<span class="chords_inline">        <strong class="chord">F</strong> 
</span>    You found me-ee-ee-ee-ee
    
    I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
    And when I fell hard, you took a step back
    Without me, without me
    Without me-ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee

</span>            It's a shame on me
            Now-ow, flew me to places I never been
            'Til you put me down, oh

            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            It's a shame on me

    Pretend he doesn't know, that he's the reason why
    You're drowning, you're drowning
    You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
    
    Now, I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
    I new notch in your belt, is all I'll ever be
    And now I see, now I see
    Now I see-ee-ee-ee-ee, ee-ee
    
        He was long gone, when he met me
        And I realize, the joke is on me... yeah
        
            I knew you were trouble when you walked in
            It's a shame on me
            Now-ow, flew me to places I never been
            'Til you put me down, oh

            I knew you were trouble when you walked in

<h4 class="section_head">Capo on 6th Fret</h4>
<p>If you want to play along with the recording, add a capo to the 6th fret and use the chords shown above. You can play it without the capo if you like -- but you'd need to play it in the key of F# (in standard tuning) to play along with the record.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here are the chords you'll need to play this song. The G/B is simply the G chord without the lowest string -- played after the C in the chorus, it helps create a walkdown from the C to G/B to the Am.</p>
