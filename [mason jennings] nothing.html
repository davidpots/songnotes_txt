</span>    Across the street to get us some water
    'Cause this water's brown and I'm so embarrassed
    To have you here but I want you around

    Usually I'd sing or play on my guitar
    But I know that won't get very far with you
    'Cause you like music that makes you move
    And mine has a groove but its nothing I can prove

</span>        When I say...

    The things that I buy, the things that I think
    Haven't made this a better place to be
    The drugs that I try, the drinks that I drink
    Haven't made this a better place to be

    It's still just a room with the drums in the middle
    The couch along the wall that works as my bed
    I still have the phone that rings all day
    I still have the things I wish I would have said

        Please know what I mean
        When I say... nothing
        When I say... nothing
        When I say... nothing
        When I say...
