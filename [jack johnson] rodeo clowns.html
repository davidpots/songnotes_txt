</span>    But here comes the music...

    Bright lights flashing they cover up you like-a
    So many people, so many problems, so many reasons to buy
    Another round, drink it down, just another night on the town

    With the big man, money man, better than the other man
    He got the plan with the million-dollar give-a-damn
    When nobody understand he'll become a smaller man
    The bright lights keep flashing and the women keep on dancing

    The disco ball's spinning, all the music and the women
    And the shots of tequila, man they say that they need ya
    But what they really need
    Is just a little room to breathe

    A teeny boppin' disco queen, she barely understands
    Her dreams of belly-button rings and other kinds of things
    Symbolic of change, but the thing that is strange
    Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part
 
        Of the herd, yeah yeah yeah
        Man I thought that you heard, yeah yeah
        The changes occurred, yeah yeah yeah
        She's just a part of the herd, yeah yeah

    Lights out, shut down, late night, wet ground
    You walk by look at him but he can't look at you, yeah
    You might feel pity but he only feels the ground because-uh
    You understand booze but he only knows let down

    (Down) by the corner there's another one
    Reachin' out a hand comin' from a broken man, well
    You try to live but he's done tryin'
    Not dead but definitely... 

        ...Dyin'
        With the rest of the clowns, yeah yeah
        Mmm mmm mmm, hmm hmm
        With the rest of the clowns, yeah yeah

<h4 class="section_head">Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here are the chords used to play this song. Note that the same four chords are used in both the verse and chorus progressions, though the order is slightly different. Listen to the recordings to get ideas for speed and dynamics (G Love's original album version is faster; Jack's album version is much more subtle).</p>
