    Ancestors told me that their girl was better
    She's richer than Croesus, she's tougher than leather
    I just ignored all the tales of a past life
    Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife

    And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
    Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
    I can still see them there huddled on Astor
    Snow falling slow to the sound of the master

        The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out... what you on about?
        I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
        I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house... such a modest mouse
        I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone

<span class="chords_inline">        (instrumental chord progression x1)
</span>
    Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
    Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
    We saw the stars when they hid from the world
    You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl

    Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
    The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
    We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
    Everyone's dying, but girl you're not old yet

        I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone

<h4 class="section_head">Capo 3rd Fret, Standard Tuning</h4>
<p>This song is in Bb, which isn't a fun key to play on guitar. So, if you add a capo to the 3rd fret and play the chords (in the key of G) as I show here, you'll be in tune with the album. You don't need to use a capo if you don't want -- and these chords by themselves will work fine, you'll just be in a different key from the album.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here's how to play the basic guitar chords used in this song. General note: you have flexibility here. You can replace the D/F# with a normal D, or likewise a G/F#. Likewise, the Bm/D can be replaced with a normal D or Bm. This is a chord progression that is pretty tough to make sound bad. Have at it your own way, to the extent you see fit.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Chord Positions for Fingerpicked Bass Walk-Down</h4>
<p>Here's how I like to play things. For each of these chords, I'm usually using a finger picking pattern that takes me from the bass note (played first for each chord) up to the higher strings. These chord positions help emphasize the walking (downward) bass note.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Chords for Playing in the Key of A (Capo 1st Fret)</h4>
<p>I'm also a fan of practicing this song in the key of A, which uses a capo on the 1st fret. This makes good use of the E/G# chord, which is tough to initially learn but fun to practice (hint: bar the middle strings of the 2nd fret with your index finger on the E/G# and also the A that precedes it). Here's the entire progression:</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|----------------2-----0----2----0----2----0----

G-|---2-----4------2-----1----2----2----2----1----

<h4 class="section_head">Recommended Guitar Lesson</h4>
<p>Here's a guitar lesson for this song by Adlai Alexander. Great if you want a close-up of how to play the progression.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>Likewise, here is a similar lesson from Shawn Perotte. Largely the same with a few small differences in the chords used. Remember, you can get away with tweaking the chords a bit -- this general progression is flexible.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Recommended Cover Version</h4>
<p>Here's a great solo acoustic cover of this song. Note, it is played with a capo on the 1st fret (which means it uses chords in the key of A). Nice job by this guy.</p>
