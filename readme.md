# Songnotes TXT & HTML Warehouse

Hello. Whenever I add a song to my www.songnotes.cc online notation collection, I first create a .txt and then .html version of the assets I've created. While the content from these .txt and .html assets will go into my web CMS, I'll also store the original contents in this repo. This serves as a backup of all my notation efforts, as well as a place for those who desire to browse a raw text version of the Songnotes library.
