<h4 class="section_head">Capo 1st Fret, Standard Tuning</h4>
<p>In order to play along with the official recorded version of this song, you'll need a capo on the 1st fret while playing the chords above in standard tuning. This obviously isn't a requirement unless you're playing along with the track. Ultimately you have flexibility to play this song in whatever key you like (with or without a capo), as the recording isn't guitar-based in any way. Have fun with it.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here is how to play the guitar chords used in this song. As always, feel free to embellish and modify these chords as you see fit. Let me also note that many online tabs for this song call for an Am as the second chord in the intro and chorus -- but I prefer an Em, as I show above. Ultimately, do what suits you and make it your own.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|----0----0-----1----3----0----
B-|----1----0-----1----0----1----
G-|----0----0-----2----0----2----
D-|----2----2-----3----0----2----
A-|----3----2-----3----2----0----
E-|---------0-----1----3---------
       <strong class="chord">C</strong>    <strong class="chord">Em</strong>    <strong class="chord">F</strong>    <strong class="chord">G</strong>    <strong class="chord">Am</strong> </pre>

<h4 class="section_head">Playing the Main Riff on Guitar</h4>
<p>While the main riff to this song is synth-based, it is possible to fake a guitar version of the main melody. Here's how I do it. Basically, you're concurrently strumming the chord progression while also emphasizing the main notes to the melody (usually these are the high E and B strings). It might not be as "clean" as a raw synth, but it sounds good in its own right. Here's how I do it, roughly (listen to the song to get an idea of the strumming rhythm -- this is simply the notes used to create the melody).</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|----0---3---0-------3---|----0---3---0----------------
B-|----1-----------3-------|----1------------/3----1-----
G-|----0-------------------|----0------------/4----0-----
D-|----2-------------------|----2------------/5----2-----
A-|----3-------------------|----3------------------------
E-|------------------------|-----------------------------
       <strong class="chord">C</strong>                        <strong class="chord">C</strong>             <strong class="chord">G</strong>    <strong class="chord">C</strong> </pre>

<p>And when the full band kicks in, you can even keep giving voice to the main melody notes while changing through the main chord progression (C - Em - F - G).  Again, listen along for the strumming.</p>


















<h4 class="section_head">Official Audio YouTube Track</h4>
<p>Here is the official YouTube video for this song, as released by the band. It is ultimately an audio track with a still image used for the video portion the entire time -- but still helpful to hear things of course.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Live Chvrches Performance</h4>
<p>Here is a video of a live performance of this song. You don't get much (anything, really) as far as watching a guitar play the song -- but watching it live is worthwhile nonetheless.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Recommended Cover</h4>
<p>Here is a great solo acoustic cover of the song from Jojo &amp; Patch. This is played using the chords above, but with the capo on the 3rd fret (instead of the 1st fret). I believe he switches to an Am instead of an Em (which I use) in the chorus, but either way the end result sounds good.</p>
