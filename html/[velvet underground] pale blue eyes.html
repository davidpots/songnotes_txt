</span>        Linger on... your pale blue eyes

    Thought of you as my mountain top
    Thought of you as my peak
    Thought of you as everything
    I've had but couldn't keep
    I've had but couldn't keep

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

    If I could make the world as pure
    And strange as what I see
    I'd put you in the mirror
    I put in front of me
    I put in front of me

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

<span class="chords_inline">    (solo, with verse + refrain chords)
</span>
    Skip a life completely
    Stuff it in a cup
    She said Money is like us in time
    It lies but can't stand up
    Down for you is up

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes

    It was good what we did yesterday
    And I'd do it once again
    The fact that you are married
    Only proves you're my best friend
    But it's truly truly a sin

        Linger on your pale blue eyes
        Linger on your pale blue eyes</pre>






















<h4 class="section_head">Capo 3rd Fret, Standard Tuning</h4>
<p>This tab uses my preferred way to play this song, which is using a capo on the 3rd fret (in standard tuning). I acknowledge that most versions online show this song played without a capo, in the key of F. That's great -- but I prefer using the capo. Note that the 3rd fret capo (using chords in the key of D, as shown here) lets you play along with someone playing in the key of F (without a capo).</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here's how to play the guitar chords used in this song. Fairly straightforward batch of chords within the key of D. I like to freely mix in a Dsus2 in the D sections to emulate the main riff heard on the recorded version.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Official Album Version</h4>
<p>Here's the official album version of this song. If you use a capo on 3rd fret and use the chords above, you can play along. Or, you can play without a capo in the key of F and play along.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Recommended Cover Versions</h4>
<p>Here's a simple, stripped down, and intimate acoustic cover version of this song. Note, this does not use a capo, but it is played with chords in the key of D. This is helpful to watch how the chord switches are made.</p>

<br /><br />

<p>Here's another version I recommend. This one is played using chords in the key of F (which is probably closer to how this song was originally performed?), instead of the key of D. Just the same, it is a good acoustic cover that you can learn a lot from.</p>
