</span>    And the candy-floss you had, and your mother and your dad

        Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain

        You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain

        You're leaving there too soon

    There's a girl just down the aisle, oh to turn and see her smile
    You can hear the words she wrote as you read the hidden note

        Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
        With the Barker's and the colored balloons
        You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
        Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
        You're leaving there too soon

<span class="chords_inline">    (intro fill x2)
</span>
    Now, you're underneath the stairs and you're given back some glares
    To the people who you met and it's your first cigarette

        Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
        With the Barker's and the colored balloons
        You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
        Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
        You're leaving there too soon

    Now, you say you're leaving home because you want to be alone
    Ain't it funny how you feel when you're finding out it's real

        Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
        With the Barker's and the colored balloons
        You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
        Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
        You're leaving there too soon

        Oh, to live on Sugar Mountain
        With the Barker's and the colored balloons
        You can't be twenty on Sugar Mountain
        Though you're thinking that you're leaving there too soon
        You're leaving there too soon

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar chords used</h4>
<p>Here are the tabs for the guitar chords used in this song. For the D, you simply slide an open <strong class="chord">C</strong> up two frets with your fingers staying in the exact same position.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|----3-----3-----0---0---1---

<h4 class="section_head">Intro / Fill Riff</h4>
<p>Here is a basic way you can play the main D and C riff heard in the intro and during the fills throughout the song. Note, this is approximate with regard to the strumming pattern -- listen along to get an idea of the actual rhythm, especially during the hammer-on segments (you want to keep your wrist/arm strumming in rhythm as you voice the bass notes). You can also add similar flourishes to the G chord strumming. Again, listen along for reference.</p>
