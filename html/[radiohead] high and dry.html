    Drying up in conversation
    You'll be the one who cannot talk
    All your insides fall to pieces
    You just sit there wishing you could still make love

    They're the ones who'll hate you when you
    Think you've got the world all sussed out
    They're the ones who'll spit at you
    You'll be the one screaming out

        Don't leave me high
        Don't leave me dry
        Don't leave me high
        Don't leave me dry

<span class="chords_inline">    (instrumental verse with solo)

    It's the best thing that you've ever had
    The best thing that you've ever, ever had
    It's the best thing that you've ever had
    The best thing you have had has gone away

        Don't leave me high
        Don't leave me dry
        Don't leave me high
        Don't leave me dry

<h4 class="section_head">Intro Riff</h4>
<p>Here is the simplest way to approach this song's intro -- in which you simply play a single pattern (which is an octave) and slide it up and down the fretboard. Listen along to get the strumming pattern right.</p>
