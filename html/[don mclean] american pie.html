</span>    I can still remember how that
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">Em</strong>                    <strong class="chord">D</strong> 
</span>    Music used to make me smile
<span class="chords_inline">        <strong class="chord">G</strong>      <strong class="chord">D/F#</strong>   <strong class="chord">Em</strong> 
</span>    And I knew if  I  had my chance

</span>    That I could make those people dance, and

</span>    Maybe they'd be happy for a while
<span class="chords_inline">         <strong class="chord">Em</strong>       <strong class="chord">Am</strong> 
</span>    But, February made me shiver
<span class="chords_inline">         <strong class="chord">Em</strong>          <strong class="chord">Am</strong> 
</span>    With every paper I'd deliver
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">C</strong>        <strong class="chord">G/B</strong>    <strong class="chord">Am</strong> 
</span>    Bad news on the doorstep

<span class="chords_inline">           <strong class="chord">Am</strong>             <strong class="chord">D</strong> 
</span>    When I read about his widowed bride

</span>        The day the music died............. I started singing

            Bye bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
            Singing, this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

        Now, for ten years we've been on our own
        And moss grows fat on a rolling stone
        But, that's not how it used to be
        When the jester sang for the king and queen
        In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
        And a voice that came from you and me
        Oh, and while the king was looking down
        The jester stole his thorny crown
        The courtroom was adjourned
        No verdict was returned
        And while Lennon read a book on Marx
        The quartet practiced in the park
        And we sang dirges in the dark
        The day the music died... we were singing

            Bye bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
            Singing, this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

        Helter Skelter in a summer swelter
        The Byrds flew off with a fallout shelter
        Eight miles high and falling fast
        It landed foul in the grass
        The players tried for a forward pass
        With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
        Now the halftime air was sweet perfume
        While the sergeants played a marching tune
        We all got up to dance
        Oh but, we never had the chance
        'Cause the players tried to take the field
        The marching band refused to yield
        Do you recall what was revealed
        The day the music died... we were singing

            Bye bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
            Singing, this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

        Oh, and there we were all in one place
        A generation lost in space
        With no time left to start, again
        So come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
        Jack Flash sat on a candle stick
        Cause fire is the devil's only friend
        Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
        My hands were clenched in fists of rage
        No angel born in hell
        Could break that Satan's spell
        And as the flames climbed high into the night
        To light the sacrificial rite
        I saw Satan laughing with delight
        The day the music died... we were singing

            Bye bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
            Singing, this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die

<span class="chords_inline">    (slower, same chords as intro / 1st verse)
</span>    I met a girl who sang the blues
    And I asked her for some happy news
    But she just smiled and turned away
    I went down to the sacred store
    Where I'd heard the music years before
    But, the man there said the music wouldn't play
    And in the streets the children screamed
    The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
    But, not a word was spoken
    The church bells all were broken
    And the three men I admire most
    The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
    They caught the last train for the coast
    The day the music died... and they were singing

            Bye bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
            And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye
            Singing, this'll be the day that I die
            This'll be the day that I die... they were singing

            Bye bye, Miss American Pie
            Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
            Them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here is how to play the guitar chords used in this song. Overall, these are played in a quite straightforward way and do not require any embellishment to make this song work. If you aiming to play the entire song, try to mix up the dynamics (some parts louder, some parts softer, etc) in order to give the song some arc... playing it at the same level of intensity for 8 minutes would get monotonous.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|---3----2----2----2----0----0----0----------0----
B-|---0----3----3----1----0----1----1----0-----2----
G-|---0----2----2----2----0----2----0----0-----0----
D-|---0----0----0----0----2----2----2----0-----2----
A-|---2----0--------------2----0----3----2-----0----
E-|---3----2--------------0-------------------------
      <strong class="chord">G</strong>   <strong class="chord">D/F#</strong>  <strong class="chord">D</strong>    <strong class="chord">D7</strong>   <strong class="chord">Em</strong>   <strong class="chord">Am</strong>   <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">G/B</strong>    <strong class="chord">A7</strong> </pre>

<p>Whenever there is a D chord used in this song (or a D7, for that matter) -- can you freely add embellishment using a Dsus2 and/or Dsus4 and it will essentially always sound good. This is done by simple adding or removing your middle &amp; pinky finger from the high E string. A simple example is as follows -- but mix it up and make it your own as you see fit. You can get a lot of mileage out of this technique in most songs using a D chord.</p>
