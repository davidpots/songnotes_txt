</span>    She doesn't get your humor like I do...

    I'm in the room, its a typical Tuesday night
    I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
    And she'll never know your story like I do...

</span>            You belong with me

    Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
    I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
    Laughing on the park bench, thinking to myself
    Hey, isn't this easy?

    And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
    I haven't seen it in a while, since she brought you down
    You say you're fine, I know you better than that
    So, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

        She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
        She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
        Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
        That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

            If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
            Been here all along so why can't you
            See------ You belong with me-----
            You belong with me

            Standing by, and waiting at your back door
            All this time how could you not know
            Baby------ You belong with me-----
            You belong with me

            You belong with me

            Have you ever thought just
