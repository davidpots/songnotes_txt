<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>    I stood alone upon the platform in vain
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">E7</strong> 
</span>    The Puerto Ricans they were playing this salsa
<span class="chords_inline">           <strong class="chord">F</strong>                                  <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>    In the rain... with open doors and manual locks
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">F</strong>             <strong class="chord">G</strong>   <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>    Fast food parking lots
    
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>    I headed west, I was a man on the move
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">E7</strong> 
</span>    New York had lied to me, I needed the truth
<span class="chords_inline">          <strong class="chord">F</strong>                                         <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>    Oh, I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust

</span>    And I don't gamble... but if I did I would bet on us

<h4 class="section_head">Chorus</h4>
<span class="chords_inline">                 <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>        Like the Dead Sea

</span>        You told me I was like the Dead Sea

</span>        Oh lord, like the Dead Sea
        
        Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
        The finest words you ever said to me
        Honey, can't you see... I was born to be
        Be your Dead Sea

    You told me you were good at running away
    Domestic life had never suited like your suitcase
    You left with just the clothes on your back
    They took the rest when you took a nap
    
    Yes, there are times we live for somebody else
    Your father died and you decided to live
    It for yourself, you felt... you just felt it was time
    And I'm glad... 'cause you with cats, that's just not right
    
        Like the Dead Sea
        You told me I was like the Dead Sea
        You'll never sink when you are with me
        Oh lord, I'm your the Dead Sea
        
        Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
        The nicest words you ever said to me
        Honey, can't you see... I was born to be
        Be your Dead Sea

</span>            You're the message, I will heed it

</span>            Would you stay with me

        Dead Sea
        You told me I was like the Dead Sea
        You'll never sink when you are with me
        Oh lord, I'm your the Dead Sea
        
        Whoa, I'm like the Dead Sea
