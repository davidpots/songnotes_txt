    Oh... 
    The motherland don't love you
    The fatherland don't love you
    So why love anything?

    Oh... good God
    The faithless they don't love you
    The zealous hearts don't love you
    And that's not gonna change

        All the cameras and files
        All the paranoid styles
        All the tension and fear
        Of a secret career

        And I can't help but feel
        That you've seen the mistakes
        But you let it go
        Ya Hey, Ya Hey, Ya Hey

            Through the fire and through the flames
            Ya hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Hey, Ya Hey
            You won't even say your name
            Ya hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Hey, Ya Hey

            Through the heart and through the flames
            You won't even say your name
            You say "I am that I am"

            But who could ever live that way?
            Ya hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Hey, Ya Hey, Ut Deo, Hey, Ut Deo

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>Here are a few ways to approach the guitar chords for this song. The key of B isn't the most friendly for novices and beginners (as you have to either use barre chords or creatively fake them somehow) -- but I feel this is a worthwhile song to learn in its intended key. Here is the "typical" formation you'll use to play the chords in this song:</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|--------0----2----------4-----4----
B-|---4----0----2----4-----4-----5----
G-|---4----1----3----6-----4-----6----
D-|---4----2----4----5-----6-----6----
A-|---2----2----4----6-----6-----4----
E-|--------0----2----------4----------
      <strong class="chord">B</strong>    <strong class="chord">E</strong>    <strong class="chord">F#</strong>  <strong class="chord">D#7</strong>   <strong class="chord">G#m</strong>   <strong class="chord">C#m</strong> </pre>

<p>And here are a few alterations of these same chords -- I tend to use these when I play. The B and E shown here are a bit of a stretch, but if you can learn them they're good to have in your bag of tricks when playing songs in the key of B or E. For the F#7 chord, I'll let the high E string ring occasionally in this song as I feel appropriate.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|---x----0---------0----
B-|---0----0----2----2----
G-|---x----4----3----3----
D-|---4----6----4----4----
A-|---6----7----4----4----
E-|---7----0--------------

<h4 class="section_head">On the Origin of this Song</h4>
<p>Here is a cool video where the Vampire Weekend dudes talk about the evolution of this song as it went from an initial idea to a finished product. Very cool to hear samples of the older versions / original directions they had in mind. For what it is worth, enjoy.</p>

<h4 class="section_head">Recommended Video Lesson</h4>
<p>Here is a great, simple video by Gene Lyndon who goes through the verse, pre-chrous, and chorus of this song played in a stripped down acoustic arrangement. This is incredibly helpful to see strumming pattern, timing, etc. Note that he uses some abbreviated fingering for some of the chords he plays -- but just the same, he's mainly using the chords I outline above. Note he is playing one-half step below standard tuning.</p>
