        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no no no... I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man----- burning out his fuse up here alone

    Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
    In fact, it's cold as hell
    And there's no one there------ to---- raise them, if you did

    And all this science, I don't understand
    It's just my job five days a week
    A rocket man------------------------- rocket man

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touch down brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no no no... I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man----- burning out his fuse up here alone

        And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
        'Til touch down brings me 'round again to find
        I'm not the man they think I am at home
        Oh, no no no... I'm a rocket man
        Rocket man----- burning out his fuse up here alone

<h4 class="section_head">Capo 3rd Fret, Standard Tuning</h4>
<p>The chords shown above assume you're using a capo on the 3rd fret -- but only worry about this if you want to play this song in the same key as the recorded Elton John version. Otherwise, you can use no capo at all (or put the capo on whatever fret you want, as suits your voice).</p>

<h4 class="section_head">How to Play the Guitar Chords</h4>
<p>To play the chords shown above on a guitar, refer to the tabs below. Of course, embellish and add flare to the extent you are capable. Note that the C/B and the G/B chords can effectively be used interchangeably -- it is their bass note that really matters. As always, listen along for the strumming pattern and exact rhythm.</p>
