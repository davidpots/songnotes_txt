<span class="chords_inline">          <strong class="chord">C</strong>    
</span>    Whoa, lookin' back at my background
<span class="chords_inline">                     <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>    Tryin' to figure out how I ever got here
<span class="chords_inline">    <strong class="chord">G7</strong> 
</span>    Some things are still a mystery to me
<span class="chords_inline">          <strong class="chord">C</strong>                  <strong class="chord">C7</strong> 
</span>    While others are much to clear

<span class="chords_inline">                      <strong class="chord">F</strong> 
</span>        And I'm just... living in the sunshine
<span class="chords_inline">                <strong class="chord">C</strong>                  <strong class="chord">Am</strong> 
</span>        Stay contented most of the time
<span class="chords_inline">              <strong class="chord">D7</strong>  
</span>        Yeah, listening to Murphy, Walker and Willis
<span class="chords_inline">                            <strong class="chord">G</strong>       <strong class="chord">G7</strong> 
</span>        Sing me their Texas rhymes

    Now most of the people who retire in Florida
    Are wrinkled and lean on a crunch
    And mobile homes are smothering my keys
    I hate those bastards so much

        I wish a... summer squall would blow them all
        Away up to fantasy land
        Yeah, they're ugly and square, they don't belong here
<span class="chords_inline">                      <strong class="chord">F</strong>          <strong class="chord">G</strong>       <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>        They looked a lot better as beer cans

<h4 class="section_head">Chorus</h4>
<span class="chords_inline">                <strong class="chord">Am</strong>  
</span>            And that's why its still a mystery to me
<span class="chords_inline">                <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>            Why some people live like they do
<span class="chords_inline">                 <strong class="chord">Am</strong>  
</span>            With so many nice things happening out there
<span class="chords_inline">                 <strong class="chord">D7</strong>                  <strong class="chord">G</strong> 
</span>            They never even seen the clues

<span class="chords_inline">                          <strong class="chord">F</strong>   
</span>                Whoa, but we're doing fine, we can travel and rhyme
<span class="chords_inline">                    <strong class="chord">C</strong>                         <strong class="chord">Am</strong> 
</span>                You know we been doin' our part
<span class="chords_inline">                      <strong class="chord">F</strong>                    <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>                Got a Caribbean soul I can barely control  
<span class="chords_inline">                         <strong class="chord">G7</strong>                      <strong class="chord">Am</strong>      <strong class="chord">C</strong> 
</span>                And some Texas hidden here in my heart

    Well now, I mighta joined the merchant marines
    If I hadn't learned how to sing
    On top of all that I got married to early
    Cost me much more than a ring

        But now those crazy days are over
        You just gotta learn from the wrong things you done
        I came off a rebound, started looking around
        Figured out its time to have a little fun

            And that's why its still a mystery to me
            Why some people live like they do
            With so many nice things happening out there
            They never even seen the clues

                Whoa, but we're doing fine, we can travel and rhyme
                You know we been doin' our part
                Got a Caribbean soul I can barely control
                And some Texas hidden here in my heart

    Well now, if I ever live to be an older man 
    I'm gonna sail down to Martinique
    I'm gonna buy me a sweat-stained Bogart suit
    And an African parakeet

        And then I'll set him on my shoulder
        And open up my trustee old mind
        I'm gonna teach him how to cuss, teach him how to fuss
        And pull the cork out of a bottle of wine

            And that's why its still a mystery to me
            Why some people live like they do
            With so many nice things happening out there
            They never even seen the clues

                Whoa, but we're doing fine, we can travel and rhyme
                You know we been doin' our part
                Got a Caribbean soul I can barely control
                And some Texas hidden here in my heart


                Yeah I got a Caribbean soul I can barely control
