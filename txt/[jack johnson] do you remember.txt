    Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
                G                D
    It was some time in early September
    You were lazy about it, you made me wait around
    I was so crazy about you, I didn't mind

    So, I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
    It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on
    I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
    You might not roll back my direction real soon  

REFRAIN
                    A
        Well, I was crazy about you then, and now the craziest thing of all
             Bm/G      Bm/F#     Em
        Over ten years have gone by... And you're still mine...  
              Em                        A       G     F#m     A
        We're locked in time... Let's rewind...

    Do you remember when we first moved in together
    The piano took up the living room
    You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
    You'd say we're playing house, now you still say we are

    We built our get-away up in a tree we found
    We felt so far away, but we were still in town
    Now, I remember watching that old tree burn down
    I took a picture that I don't like to look at

    Well, all these times these come and go and alone don't seem so long
    Over ten years have gone by... we can't rewind...
    We're locked in time... But you're still mine...

                D (let ring) 
    ...Do you remember
