THE WEATHER IS HERE, WISH YOU WERE BEAUTIFUL

INTRO
    | G . . . | C . D . | (repeat, end on C and let ring)

VERSE
       G                          C        D              G 
    He worked hard all year, just wanted a few weeks alone
    But his old lady's into modeling, she can't get away from the phone
                     C       D            G 
        Besides, she bitches about the mosquitoes
        She says down there, there is nothing to do
        Her goddamn phone never stops ringing
        She'll try the service in a day, maybe two

    He's on his third drink before the wheels of the plane leave the ground
    Making talk with the stewardess high over Long Island sound
        She's also spending some time on the islands
        Too much city madness gives her the blues
        They make a date to go dancing and dining
        It seems neither has that much to lose

CHORUS
                G                  C             G 
            The weather is here, I wish you were beautiful
               G                              F          D 
            My thoughts aren't too clear, but don't run away
               G                       C          G 
            My girlfriend's a bore, my job is too dutiful
                  C        G              F           D 
            Hell, nobodies perfect, would you like to play?
                              G 
            I feel together today
                                [repeat intro chords]

    Well now, that's just the start of a well-deserved, over-do binge
    Meanwhile back in the city certain people are starting to cringe
        His lawyers are calling his parents
        His girlfriend doesn't know what to think
        His partners are studying their options
        He's just singing and ordering drinks

            The weather is here, I wish you were beautiful
            The skies are too clear, life's so easy today
            The beer is too cold, the daiquiris too fruit-i-ful
            No place like home when your this far away
            I don't care what they say

    He's going back to New York, pack it up and let everyone know
    It was something that he should have done such a long time ago
        Still time to start a new life in the palm trees
        Ah, Billy Clyde wasn't insane
        And if it doesn't work out, they'll never be any doubt
        That the pleasure was worth all the pain

            The weather is here, I wish you were beautiful
            The skies are too clear, life's so easy today
            The beer is too cold, the daiquiris too fruit-i-ful
            No place like home when your this far away

OUTRO
                                   G       C        D           G
                I need time for to play...   I need time for to play...
                I need time for to play...   I need time for to play...
                I need time for to play...   I need time for to play...
                I need time for to play...   I need time for to play...
