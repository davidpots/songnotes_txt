VERSE
               C          F C  G    G7 
    Yeah, when I was only seventeen
            C               F   C  G   G7 
    I could hear the angels whispering
             F              C 
        So I drove into the woods
                     F      C   G 
        And wandered aimlessly about
                F               C                    G    G7 
        Until I heard my mother shouting through the fog

              C             F       C    G 
    It turned out to be the howling of a dog
             F            C 
        Or a wolf to be exact
                       F       C       G 
        The sound sent shivers down my back
                  F              C               G    G7 
        But I was drawn into the pack and before long

           C                F      C          G    G7 
    They allowed me to join in and sing their song
                    F                  C           
        So from the cliffs and highest hills
                       F      C       G 
        Yeah, we would gladly get our fill
                F             C              G    G7 
        Howling endlessly and shrilly at the dawn

          C                  F       C          G     G7 
    And I lost the taste for judging right from wrong
               F                   C 
        For my flesh had turned to fur
                     F              C      G 
        Yeah, and my thoughts, they surely were
                  F             C           G    G7 
        Turned to instinct and obedience to God

CHORUS
                    F         C           F     C  G 
            You can wear your fur, like a river on fire
                    F         C               F            G 
            But you better be sure, if you're making God a liar
                  F            C              F           G 
            I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on the fire
                             F         C 
                So if you're gonna get made
                          F        C           G       G7 
                Don't be afraid of what you've learned

    [instrumental break]

           C                 F   C  G    G7 
    On the day that I turned twenty-three
          C              F       C       G    G7 
    I was curled up underneath a dogwood tree
             F          C 
        When suddenly a girl
                      F     C    G 
        With skin the color of a pearl
                     F                  C              G    G7 
        She wandered aimlessly, but she didn't seem to see

            C                 F      C         G    G7 
    She was listening for the angels just like me
             F                 C 
        So I stood and looked about
                      F          C     G 
        I brushed the leaves off of my snout
                   F               C                    G     G7 
        And then I heard my mother shouting through the trees
	
	                  C                 F     C      G    G7 
    You should have seen that girl go shaky at the knees
             F               C 
        So I took her by the arm
                   F     C     G 
        We settled down upon a farm
                       F              C             G      G7 
        And raised our children up as gently as you please

    [instrumental break]
                   F                 C 
        And now my fur has turned to skin
                      F       C       G 
        And I've been quickly ushered in
             F               C             G    G7 
        To a world that I confess I do not know

                C                F        C           G    G7 
    But I still dream of running careless through the snow
                        F                  C 
        And through the howling winds that blow,
                   F       C       G 
        Across the ancient distant flow
                    F              C              G    G7 
        It fill our bodies up like water 'till we know

                    F         C           F     C  G 
            You can wear your fur, like a river on fire
                    F         C               F            G 
            But you better be sure, if you're making God a liar
                  F            C              F           G 
            I'm a rattlesnake, babe, I'm like fuel on the fire
                             F         C 
                So if you're gonna get made
                          F        C           G       G7 
                Don't be afraid of what you've learned
