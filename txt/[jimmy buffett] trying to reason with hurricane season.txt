TRYING TO REASON WITH HURRICANE SEASON
by Jimmy Buffett
===============================================================================
INTRO
    D (with riff)

VERSE
    D                               G                     D 
    Squalls out on the gulf stream, big storm is coming soon
      G                D              E7                         A7 
    I passed out in my hammock... and God, I slept till way past noon
    G                     D                                      C  G/B  A7 
    Stood up and tried to focus, I hoped I wouldn't have to look far
      G                         D          A7                        D 
    I knew I could use a Bloody Mary, so I stumbled next door to the bar

CHORUS
                  Bm                    F#m 
        And now I must confess, I could use some rest
        G              A7             D 
        I can't run at this pace very long
                  Bm                       F#m 
        Yes, it's quite insane, I think it hurts my brain
               G                  A7            D 
        But it cleans me out, and then I can go on

    There's something about this Sunday, it's a most peculiar gray
    Strollin' down the avenue that's known as A1A
    Feelin' tired then I got inspired, I knew that it wouldn't last long
    So all alone I walked back home sat on my beach and then I made up this song

        And now I must confess, I could use some rest
        I can't run at this pace very long
        Yes, it's quite insane, I think it hurts my brain
        But it cleans me out, and then I can go on

    Well, the wind is blowing harder now, fifty knots, or thereabouts
    There's whitecaps on the ocean, and I'm watching for water-spouts
    It's time to close the shudders, it's time to go inside
    In a week I'll be in gay Paris, that's a mighty-long airplane ride

        And now I must confess, I could use some rest
        I can't run at this pace very long
        Yes, it's quite insane, I think it hurts my brain
        But it cleans me out, and then I can go on
