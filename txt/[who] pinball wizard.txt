PINBALL WIZARD
by The Who
===============================================================================
INTRO
    Bm (droning riff with walkdown, see tab below) 

    Bsus4 ... B ... x4 

VERSE
         Bsus4                         B 
    Ever since I was a young boy, I've played the silver ball
         Asus4                    A 
    From Soho down to Brighton, I must have played 'em all
          Gsus4                           G 
    But I ain't seen anything like him in any amusement hall
         F# 
    That deaf, dumb, and blind kid... sure plays a mean pinball
                                                B B → A → D → E ... x2 

    He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
    Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
    Plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
    That deaf, dumb, and blind kid... sure plays a mean pinball

CHORUS
               E  F#   B 
        He's a pinball wizard
              E      F#   B 
        There has to be a twist
          E  F#   B            G             D     Dsus4  D 
        A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist

BRIDGE
            D          Cadd9 G  D          Cadd9 G 
            How do you think he does it? I don't know
            D          Cadd9  G  D 
            What makes him--- so good?

    Ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzers and bells
    Don't see no lights a-flashing, plays by sense of smell
    Always gets the replay, never seen him fall
    That deaf, dumb, and blind kid... sure plays a mean pinball

        I thought I was
        The Bally table king
        But I just handed my pinball crown to him

ENDING VERSE

            (same as normal verse, but modulated up 3 half-steps)

            Dsus4 ... D ... x4 

                 Dsus4                    D 
            Even on my favorite table, he can beat my best
                Csus4                      C 
            His disciples lead him in, and he just does the rest
                 Bbsus4                     Bb 
            He's got crazy flipper fingers, never seen him fall
                 A 
            That deaf, dumb, and blind kid... sure plays a mean pinball
                                                D D → C → F → Bb (let ring)

NOTES & TABS
===============================================================================

Intro Tab
This intro tab starts with a Bm shaped chord and with each measure makes a single change, with all the while you consistently picking the same bass note. Definitely listen along for reference.

e-|--2-----------------0-----------------0------------------0----------------|-
B-|--3-----------------3-----------------2------------------2----------------|-
G-|--4-----------------4-----------------4------------------3----------------|-
D-|--4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4---4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4---4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4----4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4--|-
A-|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-
E-|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-
     Bm 

 -|--0-----------------0------------------------------------0----------------|-
 -|-(2)----------------0-----------------0------------------2----------------|-
 -|--2-----------------0-----------------4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4----3-3-3-3-3-3-3-3--|-
 -|--4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4---4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4---5-5-5-5-5-5-5-5----4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4--|-
 -|---------------------------------------------------------4-4-4-4-4-4-4-4--|-
 -|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-
                                                            F# 

After the F#, move to the Bsus4 → B progression used in the verse (which you'll repeat a few times before starting the verse proper).

Verse
Here's the general chord shaping you'll want to use for the verse, as well as the second half of the intro (where the heavy strumming comes in). The most important thing here is probably voicing that added sus4 note that comes and goes, so find a chord fingering style that works for you. Also, note that this same exact approach is used for the final verse -- which is modulated up 3 half-steps... basically, add 3 frets to everything you see here and you'll have it.

e-|---7----7-------5----5-------3----3------2----
B-|---7----7-------5----5-------3----3------2----
G-|---9----8-------7----6-------5----4------3----
D-|---9----9-------7----7-------5----5------4----
A-|---9----9-------7----7-------5----5------4----
E-|---7----7-------5----5-------3----3------2----
    Bsus4  B     Asus4  A     Gsus4  G      F# 

Here's the chords for the section played at the end of each verse (immediately after "...sure plays a mean pinball"). This is played twice.
e-|------------------------------------------2-----0--0---
B-|-----------------------------4--4-----2---3-----0--0---
G-|-----------------------------4--4-----2---2-----1--1---
D-|-----------------------------4--4-----2---0-----2--2---  x2
A-|-----------------------------2--2-----0---------2--2---
E-|------------------------------------------------0--0---
                                B        A   D     E 
     "Sure plays a mean pinball..."

Chorus
Nothing too tricky here, though you'll need to have your barre chords down. Again, listen along for the exact timing.

e-|-----------0--2------------------0------2------------|-
B-|-----------0--2----4-------------0------2----4-------|-
G-|-----------1--3----4-------------1------3----4-------|-
D-|-----------2--4----4-------------2------4----4-------|-
A-|-----------2--4----2-------------2------4----2-------|-
E-|-----------0--2------------------0------2------------|-
              E  F#   B             E      F#   B 
      "He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist..."
      
 -|------0--2---------------------3-------------2-------3----2----
 -|------0--2----4----------------0-------------3-------3----3----
 -|------1--3----4----------------0-------------2-------2----2----
 -|------2--4----4----------------0-------------0-------0----0----
 -|------2--4----2----------------2-------------------------------
 -|------0--2---------------------3-------------------------------
         E  F#   B                G             D     Dsus4  D 
      "A pinball wizard, he's got such a supple wrist..."

Bridge
In the bridge section, you'll want to do this simple walkdown from C to Cadd9 to G. You can also add a C/B in there too. Listen along, and check out the tutorial videos for reference. This is approximate, but should suffice.

e-|----2----------3-----3-----2----------3-----3-----
B-|----3----------3-----3-----3----------3-----3-----
G-|----2----------0-----0-----2----------0-----0-----
D-|----0----------2-----0-----0----------2-----0-----   etc
A-|---------------3-----2----------------3-----2-----
E-|---------------------3----------------------3-----
       D        Cadd9   G     D        Cadd9   G 
      "How do you think he--- does it, I don't know..."

Recommended Cover Version
Here is a terrific video of Mike Masse doing an acoustic version of this song. This is a great example of how a single guitar can still make this song rock.

Recommended Guitar Lesson
If you want an in-depth look of how to play the entire song on acoustic guitar, I recommend this video. Each section of the song is carefully deconstructed. The video quality is quite good as well.
