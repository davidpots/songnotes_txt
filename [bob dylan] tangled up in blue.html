</span>    Early one morning the sun was shining
    I was laying in bed
    Wondering if she'd changed at all
<span class="chords_inline">           <strong class="chord">D2</strong> 
</span>    If her hair was still red
    
    Her folks, they said our lives together
    Sure was gonna be rough
    They never did like mama's homemade dress
    Papa's banquet wasn't big enough

    She was married when we first met
    soon to be divorced
    Helped her out of a jam I guess
    But I used a little too much force
    
    We drove that car as far as we could
    Abandoned it out west
    Split up on the docks at night
    Both agreeing that it was best

        She turned around to look at me
        As I was walking away
        I heard her say over my shoulder
        "We'll meet again someday on the avenue"
        Tangled up in blue

    I had a job in the great north woods
    Workin' as a cook for a spell
    But I never did like it all that much
    And one day the axe just fell

    So I drifted down to New Orleans
    Where my luck it was to be employed
    Workin' for a while on a fishing boat
    Right outside of Delacroix

        But all the while I was alone
        The past was close behind
        I've seen a lot of women
        But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
        Tangled up in blue

    She was working in a topless place
    And I stopped in for a beer
    I just kept lookin' at the side of her face
    In the spotlight so clear

    And later on when the crowd thinned down
    I was just about to do the same
    She was standing there in back of my chair
    Said to me "Don't I know your name?"

        I muttered something underneath my breath
        She studied the lines on my face
        I must admit I felt a little uneasy
        When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
        Tangled up in blue

    She lit a burner on the stove
    And offered me a pipe
    "I thought you'd never say hello," she said
    "You look like the silent type."
    
    Then she opened up a book of poems
    And handed it to me
    Written by an Italian poet
    From the thirteenth century

        And everyone of them words rang true
        And glowed like burning coal
        Pouring off of every page
        Like it was written in my soul from me to you
        Tangled up in blue

    I lived with him on Montague Street
    In a basement down the stairs
    There was music in the cafes at night
    And revolution in the air

    And he started into dealing with slaves
    And something inside of him died
    She had to sell everything she owned
    And froze up inside

        And when then finally the bottom fell out
        I became withdrawn
        The only thing I knew how to do
        Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
        Tangled on in blue

    So now I'm going back again
    I get to get to her somehow
    All the people we used to know
    They're an illusion to me now

    Some are mathematicians
    Some are carpenters wives
    Don't know how it all got started
    I don't know what they're doing with their lives

        But me, I'm still on the road
        Heading for another joint
        We always did feel the same
        We just saw it from a different point of view
        Tangled up in blue</pre>
