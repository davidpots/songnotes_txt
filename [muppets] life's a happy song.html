<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords Used</h4>
<p>For the most part, this song uses the following chords (all in the key of C). There are additional chords used in the second half of the song, which modulates up to C# and then D (I show all these chords further down in this section). Ultimately, what you need to understand is that the tonal progression of each section is the same -- no matter what key you're in. More on this later.</p>
<p>Otherwise -- here are the main chords used in this song, as played in the open position (i.e., without using barre chords). Further below I'll describe how to play these songs in a way that better capture the ascending sound heard on the soundtrack version of this song.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|---0---1---0----1----3---0---
B-|---1---3---0----1----0---1---
G-|---0---2---0----2----0---2---
D-|---2---0---2----3----0---2---
A-|---3-------2----3----2---0---
E-|-----------0----1----3-------
      <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">Dm</strong>  <strong class="chord">Em</strong>   <strong class="chord">F</strong>    <strong class="chord">G</strong>   <strong class="chord">Am</strong> </pre>

<h4 class="section_head">Capturing the Sound of the Verse Walk-Up</h4>
<p>The chords in the verse section have a nice ascending, "rising" sound to them as you move from one chord to another. To capture the essence of this on an acoustic guitar, you'll want to use chord positions that likewise rise up the fretboard. Here are a few ways to do this.</p>
<p>One approach is this version, which focuses on the highest four strings.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|---0---1---3---5---
B-|---1---3---5---6---
G-|---0---2---4---5---
D-|---2---0---5---7---
A-|---3---------------
E-|-------------------
      <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">Dm</strong>  <strong class="chord">Em</strong>  <strong class="chord">F</strong> </pre>

<p>Or, you can focus on the middle four strings using standard barre chord positions. This approach works well when you (later on) modulate up to C# and then D.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|-------------------
B-|---5---6---8--10---
G-|---5---7---9--10---
D-|---5---7---9--10---
A-|---3---5---7---8---
E-|-------------------
      <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">Dm</strong>  <strong class="chord">Em</strong>  <strong class="chord">F</strong> </pre>

<h4 class="section_head">Guitar Chords, with Modulation</h4>
<p>The song modulates (i.e., changes key) to C# and then D later in the song. The basic idea I mention above about using the same pattern of chords (as you walk up during the verse) applies to each key, as you can see below. The modulation is certainly not a requirement to play the song -- but if you want to tackle it, this should help.</p>
<p>For the key of C:</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|-------------------------5---
B-|---5---6---8---10---12---5---
G-|---5---7---9---10---12---5---
D-|---5---7---9---10---12---7---
A-|---3---5---7----8---10---7---
E-|-------------------------5---
      <strong class="chord">C</strong>   <strong class="chord">Dm</strong>  <strong class="chord">Em</strong>   <strong class="chord">F</strong>    <strong class="chord">G</strong>   <strong class="chord">Am</strong> </pre>

<p>For the key of C#:</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|-------------------------------6---
B-|---6-----7----9----11----13----6---
G-|---6-----8---10----11----13----6---
D-|---6-----8---10----11----13----8---
A-|---4-----6----8-----9----11----8---
E-|-------------------------------6---
      <strong class="chord">C#</strong>   <strong class="chord">D#m</strong>  <strong class="chord">E#m</strong>   <strong class="chord">F#</strong>    <strong class="chord">G#</strong>   <strong class="chord">A#m</strong> </pre>

<p>For the key of D:</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|------------------------------
B-|---7---8---10---12---14---3---
G-|---7---9---11---12---14---4---
D-|---7---9---11---12---14---4---
A-|---5---7----9---10---12---2---
E-|------------------------------
      <strong class="chord">D</strong>   <strong class="chord">Em</strong>  <strong class="chord">F#m</strong>   <strong class="chord">G</strong>    <strong class="chord">A</strong>   <strong class="chord">Bm</strong> </pre>

<h4 class="section_head">Intro Guitar Tab</h4>
<p>There is a short xylophone intro to this song in the original soundtrack recording. Here is how I approximate that on guitar. This is totally optional of course! But I wanted to include it for reference.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|---0-------0----3------|-------/5--3--0--------------0---||
B-|---1----3----------1---|---1----------------------1--1---||
G-|---0-------------------|------------------0--0h2-----0---||
D-|---2-------------------|-----------------------------2---||
A-|---3-------------------|-----------------------------3---||
E-|-----------------------|---------------------------------||</pre>

<p>Or, if you wanted to avoid the open C in the first measure (which I find harder to play for some reason, in this specific context) you can use this approach. It is the same notes, just less reliance on open strings. Playing this, you'd want to bar your index finger across the 3rd fret, for the first measure at least.</p>

<pre class="pre_notes">e-|----------------3------|--------5--3--0--------------0---||
B-|---5----3--5-----------|--------------------------1--1---||
G-|-------------------5---|---5--------------0--0h2-----0---||
D-|-----------------------|-----------------------------2---||
A-|-----------------------|-----------------------------3---||
E-|-----------------------|---------------------------------||</pre>
