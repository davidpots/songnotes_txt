SUBMARINES
by The Lumineers
===============================================================================

VERSE
    G         C     G      D 
    I believe submarines
    G          C         G    D 
    Underneath deep blue sea
    G              C    G     D 
    Saw the flags, Japanese
    G           C       G    D 
    No one will believe me

CHORUS    
        Em                        D 
        Ran back to the town bar, and
          G 
        I told the people how
        Em                 D 
        I had seen a submarine
            C 
        And everyone laughed aloud

BREAK    
            G     C  G     D  (x2, normal)
    
    I did spy a periscope
    Dead of night on the eastern coast
    The police made them jokes
    Told me I'd seen a ghost
    
        Everyone thinks I'm a lie
        And no one knows the truth
        If it was a bigger fire
        I would be on the roof
    
            G     C  G     D  (x2, quiet)
            G     C  G     D  (x2, normal)
    
    Ships will rust in Baldwin Bay (Let me go!)
    No one trust what I say (I don't know!)
    Oh my God, no one paid (Attention!)
    Overnight my head turned grey (Oh, oh, oh!)
    
        In the end it boils down
        To credibility
        I have none, so I will die
        With the secrets of the sea
    
            G     C  Em    D  (x2, loud!)
            G     C  G     D  (x2, normal)
    
    Submarine... (Submarine!)
