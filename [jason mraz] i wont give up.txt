INTRO
    (see below for intro guitar tab)
    A  .. E  .. E .. E ..  x 3
    B4 .. B4 .. B .. B ..  x 1

VERSE
                     A    E 
    When I look into your eyes
                           A     E 
    It's like watching the night sky
                   A  E 
    Or a beautiful sunrise
                               Bsus4   B 
    Well, there's so much they hold

    And just like them old stars
    I see that you've come so far
    To be right where you are
    How old is your soul?

                           A     E 
        Well, I won't give up on us
                    C#m       B 
        Even if the skies get rough
                       A      E 
        I'm giving you all my love
                          Bsus4   B 
        I'm still looking up

    And when you're needing your space
    To do some navigating
    I'll be here patiently waiting
    To see what you find

        'Cause even the stars they burn
        Some even fall to the earth
        We've got a lot to learn
        God knows we're worth it

                         A 
        No, I won't give up...

BRIDGE
                    F#m 
            I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
                                                          B 
            I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
                F#m 
            Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
                                                       B 
            The tools and gifts we got, yeah, we got a lot at stake

                           D 
                And in the end, you're still my friend, at least we did intend
                For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
                D#° 
                ...We had to learn, how to bend, without the world, caving in
                D                                D#°                          E 
                ...I had to learn, what I've got, and what I'm not, and who I am

        I won't give up on us
        Even if the skies get rough
        I'm giving you all my love
        I'm still looking up, still looking up

        Well, I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)
        God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)
        We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)
        God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)

        (let chords ring)
        I won't give up on us
        Even if the skies get rough
        I'm giving you all my love
        I'm still looking up
